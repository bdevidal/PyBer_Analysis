# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview:

We have been tasked by Management to create a Summary Data Frame of our ride sharing data, showing total rides, total number of drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver, all broken down by our three population density classifications (urban, suburban, and rural). We are also tasked with creating a visualization of our weekly total fares by population type over a specific four month period. We believe this data may be useful in determining future courses of action.

## Results:

As can be seen from the above data, while total revenue from rural fares, the average fares per ride and per driver are quite high, relative to urban fares. This likely reflects both the longer individual trips and limited number of drivers available in less densly populated areas. As would be expected, suburban numbers are generally somewhere between the urban and rural numbers.

As might be expected from the previous summary data, on a week by week basis total fares break down roughly the same, with the most gross revenue coming from urban areas (yellow), followed by suburban areas (red), and finally rural areas (blue). Suburban fare totals would appear to have the most volitility week to week.

## Summary:

Things we may want to consider:

* While rural revenue represents a relatively small portion of our totals, it is also likely where we have the most opertunity. Low driver numbers and high per ride and per driver fare averages may indicate that we have room to grow, as well as a compelling pitch to onboard new drivers.

* Likewise, although urban revenue makes up the largest share of income, we may want to consider if we are overextended. Currently our total number of drivers greatly exceeds our total rides provided in urban areas. We may be able to reduce overhead via headcount reductions.

* As an alternative to the last point (since I know we would prefer to not let anyone go), our ride-to-driver numbers in urban areas may indicate that we might want to consider a strategic investment in platform advertising to increase awareness and drive usage. We are well outside of saturating our available driver base, so we could probably push hard before we start running into availability issues.
